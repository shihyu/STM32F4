  69:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * main() can be configured to create either a very simple LED flasher demo, or
  70:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * a more comprehensive test/demo application.
  71:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  *
  72:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * To create a very simple LED flasher example, set the
  73:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_LED_FLASHER_DEMO_ONLY constant (defined below) to 1.  When
  74:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * this is done, only the standard demo flash tasks are created.  The standard
  75:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * demo flash example creates three tasks, each of which toggle an LED at a
  76:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * fixed but different frequency.
  77:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  *
  78:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * To create a more comprehensive test and demo application, set
  79:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_LED_FLASHER_DEMO_ONLY to 0.

  82:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  *
  83:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * In addition to the normal set of standard demo tasks, the comprehensive test
  84:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * makes heavy use of the floating point unit, and forces floating point
  85:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * instructions to be used from interrupts that nest three deep.  The nesting
  86:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * starts from the tick hook function, resulting is an abnormally long context
  87:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * switch time.  This is done purely to stress test the FPU context switching
  88:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * implementation, and that part of the test can be removed by setting
  89:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * configUSE_TICK_HOOK to 0 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.
  90:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  ******************************************************************************
  91:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  *
  92:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * main() creates all the demo application tasks and software timers, then starts
  93:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * the scheduler.  The web documentation provides more details of the standard
  94:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * demo application tasks, which provide no particular functionality, but do
  95:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * provide a good example of how to use the FreeRTOS API.
  96:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  *
  97:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
  98:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * defined and/or created within this file:
  99:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  *
 100:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * "Reg test" tasks - These fill both the core and floating point registers with
 101:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * known values, then check that each register maintains its expected value for
 102:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * the lifetime of the task.  Each task uses a different set of values.  The reg
 103:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * test tasks execute with a very low priority, so get preempted very
 104:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * frequently.  A register containing an unexpected value is indicative of an
 105:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * error in the context switching mechanism.
 106:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  *
 107:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * "Check" timer - The check software timer period is initially set to three
 108:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * seconds.  The callback function associated with the check software timer
 109:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * checks that all the standard demo tasks, and the register check tasks, are
 110:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * not only still executing, but are executing without reporting any errors.  If
 111:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * the check software timer discovers that a task has either stalled, or
 112:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * reported an error, then it changes its own execution period from the initial
 113:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * three seconds, to just 200ms.  The check software timer callback function
 114:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * also toggles an LED each time it is called.  This provides a visual
 115:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * indication of the system status:  If the LED toggles every three seconds,
 116:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * then no issues have been discovered.  If the LED toggles every 200ms, then
 117:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * an issue has been discovered with at least one task.
 118:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  *
 119:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * Tick hook - The application tick hook is called from the schedulers tick
 120:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * interrupt service routine when configUSE_TICK_HOOK is set to 1 in
 121:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * FreeRTOSConfig.h.  In this example, the tick hook is used to test the kernels
 122:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * handling of the floating point units (FPU) context, both at the task level
 123:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * and when nesting interrupts access the floating point unit registers.  The
 124:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * tick hook function first fills the FPU registers with a known value, it
 125:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * then triggers a medium priority interrupt.  The medium priority interrupt
 126:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * fills the FPU registers with a different value, and triggers a high priority
 127:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * interrupt.  The high priority interrupt once again fills the the FPU
 128:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * registers with a known value before returning to the medium priority
 129:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * interrupt.  The medium priority interrupt checks that the FPU registers
 130:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * contain the values that it wrote to them, then returns to the tick hook
 131:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * function.  Finally, the tick hook function checks that the FPU registers
 132:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * contain the values that it wrote to them, before it too returns.
 133:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  *
 134:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * Button interrupt - The button marked "USER" on the starter kit is used to
 135:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * demonstrate how to write an interrupt service routine, and how to synchronise
 136:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * a task with an interrupt.  A task is created that blocks on a test semaphore.
 137:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * When the USER button is pressed, the button interrupt handler gives the
 138:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * semaphore, causing the task to unblock.  When the task unblocks, it simply
 139:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * increments an execution count variable, then returns to block on the
 140:App/STM32F4-Discovery/main.c ****  * semaphore again.
